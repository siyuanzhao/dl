explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|the difference between the terms of  genocide and ethnic cleansing  is that an ethnic cleansing is trying to create a ethnically homogeneous area, meaning one ethnic group to rule their own area rather than a diverse ethnic population.  genocide, however, is the destruction of a group of people based on their race, religion, etc. genocide seeks to destroy, kill, prevent births, and forced emigration. ethnic cleansing seeks to remove, not destroy, the victims of target. an example of genocide in history is the holocaust, where hitler believed the german "race" was superior and had to maintain the purity of the bloodline by destroy jews, gypsies, homosexuals, the disabled, and many more. an example of ethnic cleansing in history is in bosnia, where the people of croatia, bosnia, and serbia, all fought and forced one another into their own areas.|

explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing is that in ethnic cleansing, the perpetrators are trying to get rid of a certain ethnic group, religion, or race but their intent is not to destroy them. in genocide, the perpetrators want the race, religion, ethnic group gone completely from the rest of their country/the world. the holocaust is an example of genocide because hitler wanted all of the jews out of europe and found ways to kill them (and other groups) in mass numbers. what happened in bosnia is an ethnic cleansing because they wanted states inhabited by that ethnicity (serbia for serbs, bosnia for bosniaks) but if there was a person with both bosnian and serbian blood in them, the serbs wouldn't kill them because they were somewhat serb. serbians were trying to make more serbs so instead of killing people who were bosniaks, men would impregnate the bosnian women so they would have "serb" children.  serbians were not trying to kill all bosnians, they were trying to create more serbs.|

explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide and ethnic cleansing differ in their goals, the groups they target, and the acts they include. genocide is the attempt to destroy, in whole or in part, a group of people, while ethnic cleansing is the attempt to create an area that contains only one ethnic group by forcibly deporting and removing members of a different ethnic group. genocide and ethnic cleansing are also different in that genocide can be directed at members of a religious, ethical, national, or other groups, while ethnic cleansing is directed at members of a certain ethnic group. genocide can involve killing members of a group, causing serious harm to members of a group, imposing deadly conditions on members of a group, preventing births within the group, or moving the children of the group to another group, while ethnic cleansing can include destroying the ethnic group's houses of warship, cemeteries, and monuments. an example of genocide is the holocaust, and an example of ethnic cleansing are the events in bosnia.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|the term genocide means to kill off, or harm-physically or mentally- members of an ethnic, religious or other group. an example of this is in the holocaust when hitler and his followers killed off jews in germany because he saw them as insuperior to the german aryan race and believed that to be a significant reason to kill them in the millions. an ethnic cleansing is where a government tries to remove a specific race from an area in hopes of creating a more pure gene pool. an example of this is in rwanda when the hutu population believed that the tutsis were not worthy of their blood and wanted them to no longer be part of their area in hopes that there would be less reproduction of them in that area.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is the extermination of a race. ethnic cleansing is just the removal of an ethnicity in that region of the world (typically country). the holocaust is an example of genocide. the nazi's wanted the entire jewish population wiped out. the bosnian war in yugoslavia however is an example of ethnic cleansing. bosnia wanted to remove the muslims for their country in one way or another and did so by sending them out of their borders or in concentration camps.|

explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.5|the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing is that in the jewish genocide it was originally cut out to be an ethnic cleansing which means that a race is to be driven out of an area.  the germans started out with the ethnic cleansing by transporting people out of the country and everything was going good till the revolts and the rebellion.  then people were being murdered in gas chambers and in the definition of genocide is the killing in whole or in part of a race, ethnicity, or gender.  the rwandan genocide was the only genocide that started from another country through imperialism.  families turned on families, neighbor turned on neighbor and that was all formed by the europeans telling the rwanda's that they are better than everyone else and converting them to christianity.|

explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.75|the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing is that the definition of genocide states "actions committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part...". this doesn't exist in the definition of ethnic cleansing. genocide is done with the intent to kill, to destroy or annihilate the entire population. ethnic cleansing is done with the intent simply to get rid of them in the geographic area. killing is involved in ethnic cleansing, but it isn't the initial intent. one example of genocide was the rwandan genocide, because the hutus wanted to kill the tutsis, it was their initial intent. one example of ethnic cleansing was the holocaust, because the nazis' original reason for getting rid of the jews, other than antisemitism, was living space. germany wanted to be self sufficient. the nazis used forced emigration as a first solution, then turned to extermination when that wasn't fast, efficient, and cheap enough.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.75|a genocide is intentionally destroying in whole or in part of a group of people. an ethnic cleansing is killing in whole or in part of an ethnic group. a genocide would be when the nazis took the jews into concentration camps and made them work then send them to death camps. an ethnic cleansing would be when the hutu tried to wipe out the tutsi ethnic group in rwanda. i kind of think that the hutu trying to kill that many people of an ethnic group might as well be genocide.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is when something is done with the intent to destroy a ethnic, religious,social, or racial group, most of the time this is done through murder. whereas ethnic cleansing is when something is done to get rid of an ethnic group, often done through deportation and displacement. the holocaust is a genocide, whereas rwanda is considered an ethnic cleansing.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.5|genocide is when someone is killed or harmed in any way. jews were their own group and hitler didn't like jews when he came to power in germany. they were put in concentration camps to die. the jews were led on death marches so there was no evidence that proved what hitler did and that concentration camps existed. ethnic cleansing is when there are major ethnic groups living in one spot and people are displaced by moving them away from their original ethnic groups. in rwanda, the hutu don't like the tutsi so the hutu would get rid of them so there would only be one ethnic group above the others.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is when a certain group of people are being killed for their religion or ethnic origin. genocide is carried out in many different ways some of these include death camps, shootings, sterilization of women to prevent reproduction, and some children were kidnapped to be forced to live as a different religion or ethnic group. ethnic cleansing on the other hand was mainly used to try and evacuate a group of people out of a certain land area. an example of genocide is when the holocaust occurs and tons of jews and other groups were put into death camps and were sometimes just killed because the nazis saw them as an in superior race. an example of ethnic cleansing would be during the rwanda revolution because the hutu wanted to evacuate the tutsi because they felt that they were superior and they shouldn't have to work for the tutsi anymore.|
