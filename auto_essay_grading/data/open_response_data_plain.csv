describe what is happening in the ovaries during each of the four stages of the menstrual cycle.|1|in stage 1 the ovaries receive fsh (follicle stimulating hormones) from the pituitary glands and a follicle is formed. then in stage 2 the follicle continues maturing the egg and releasing estrogen. the estrogen repairs the uterine lining or endometrium. then in stage 3 or the 14th day the egg is released. (ovulation) the pituitary gland then stops it's fsh production and suddenly sends out a massive dose of lh. the follicles in the ovaries explode and form a corpus leudium. the corpus leudium releases progesterone which prepares the egg for pregnancy. finally in the last stage, the egg is either fertilized or its not. the pituitary gland stops its production of hormones, and the uterine lining thickens. if the egg is fertilized, the ovaries will send it out to the uterus which holds the baby until birth. if the egg is not fertilized the ovaries will absorb it into the body.|
describe what is happening in the ovaries during each of the four stages of the menstrual cycle.|1|in the first stage of the menstrual cycle, a follicle in one of the ovaries will begin to mature an egg. this begins due to the release of large amounts of fsh. the ovaries also release estrogen during this time. in the second stage of the menstrual cycle the egg continues to mature within the follicle and the ovaries continue to secrete estrogen. on day 14 the follicle ruptures and releases an ovum into the fallopian tubes. the follicle becomes a corpus luteum and begins to secrete progesterone instead of estrogen. this all occurs due to the release of a massive amount of lh by the pituitary. in the third stage of the menstrual cycle the egg moves down the fallopian tubes heading towards the uterus. the corpus luteum continues to release progesterone and the pituitary continues the secretion of the lh. during the fourth stage of the menstrual cycle the ovum has reached the uterus and the endometrium has reached its maximum thickness. the corpus luteum continues to secrete progesterone and the pituitary continues with the secretion of lh. within a few days menstruation will occur if the egg is not fertilized.|

essay question: use details from the poem to support your answer. how does the snake seems to change in the poem?|1|"carrying the snake to the garden" tells a story about the guilt, fear, and curiosity of the main character as well as how the snake percieves humans to be. at first the snake is viewed as small and weak. this is so because of the way the author describes its size, and its two eyes set into coal, which implies it to be frozen with fear. when it states that the snake's tail quivered, that is also sign of being fearful. like a young, scared child, the snake stuck in the basement is afraid of the things he has never seen before. after the main character has scooped up the snake, they feel guilt. they are guilty of the fact that they have disturbed and frightened the innocent snake. the snake is now even more frightened than before because the person has come into the snake's "home" and snatched it away. when the snake is reunited with the outside world is when he realizes the true intentions of the human. the snake is cautiously placed on the soft grass, and let free in the blink of an eye. but what he chooses to do instead of fleeing, is to take one last look at the person who invaded his personal space, snatched him up, and carried him out like a rag doll. by the end of the poem though, the snake realizes that maybe it was not intended for the human to do these things to cause harm to the snake, but rather to return him to where he belongs. when the snake looked like it would sing, that showed the joy it had brought him to know that he was free, and that he could have faith in this person.|

essay question: use details from the poem to support your answer. how does the snake seems to change in the poem?|1|the snake does change throughout the poem. in the beginning of the poem the narrator describes the snake as scared and coiled in their cellar. but the snake is not only scared and coiled, but also cautious as he/she watches the narrator make their way towards the snake. when the narrator gets close enough to the snake, they flee for their life. although the snake seemed tough and dangerous coiled like rope in the corner, once confronted it fled for its life.once the narrator is holding the snake it seems almost desperate to leave. the snake turns and turns and tries to escape the narrators hands. the snake expected the narrator to either kill it or drop it. the narrator feels guilty for the snake's fear and knows it would rather be outside, so the narrator carries it there.once the snake is let out of the narrator's hands and onto the ground outside the snake stays still for a bit, petrified. after a moment when the snake thinks the narrator will suspect it least, the snake goes back to tough guy mode. it slithers away fast as light. and as the narrator says, "and then it was gone".the narrator conveys the snakes changes in various ways. in the beginning the narrator uses a similie and describes the snake as a running shoelace. this gives the reader a picture of the snake's thin, long body and tries to, well, run.right before the snake leaves at the end of the poem is the most drastic change however. maybe the narrator was just imagining this, which is quite possible, but for the sake of this essay let's say it happened. the narrator says that the snake lifted its head and looked as if it was going to sing right before it fled. i think the poet is trying to say that the snake was very grateful for the narrators help, so thankful it was filled with enough joy to sing. but the snake wasn't grateful enough to stick around to say thanks.over all, i think the snake changed a bit due to what was happening in the poem. however, i think the snake's reactions might've been a bit different because the poet seems biased towards the snake in the poem so they portayed it in a beneficial light.|

essay question: use details from the poem to support your answer. how does the snake seems to change in the poem?|1|throughout the poem, the snake seems to change. in the beginning of the poem the snake is very cautious of the approaching author and when he/she comes too close, it flees. in lines 6-14, examples of these traits can be found. the poem uses phrases such as "and watched me with eyes like two little stars set in coal" and "one step of my foot and it fled". my interpretations of these lines were that the snake is determining if it is safe to let the approaching being come close or whether it should leave in a hurry which it did. the snake seems very aware that it may be in harm. in lines 19-20 and 26-29 a seemingly different character replaces the snake. in lines 19-20 it says that the author is sorry for the fear of the snake that is why he/she hurries to bring it outside. in lines 26-29 the snake is squirming to try to get out of the cupped hand it is in but when it is let down it doesn't move. it just stays there with its head up. the narrator thinks for a minute of what this action could mean. they wonder if the snake is going to slide up into there pocket or if it will sing. while the narrator is being curious the snake disappears. the snake is very skiddish and cautious in the beginning and becomes frightened as it is scooped up. however, once it is set down and free to escape it just stays where it is. this action seems to represent a change in attitude of the snake. it is no longer scared and quick to escape but is almost thankful and friendly to the narrator. the snake seems to become less worried by the end.|
essay question: use details from the poem to support your answer. how does the snake seems to change in the poem?|1|how did the snake change in the poem 'carrying the snake to the garden'? there are many ways that the snake changed. at first the snake was cold, but then when we see an ellpsis and we feel a pause affect. the author picks the snake up and takes it out side. then just for a seond it show it's thanks. what was the snake like at first? the snake was coiled into itself and just watched the author. not even moving it showed it's eyes, which are like two little stars set into coal. it's tail was also quivering, which showed that the snake is scared of something, but what? the author knows that the snake is scared of her. when we see the snakes tail quivere the ellpsis comes into play. that shows you a very dramatic affect to the peom. when the author moved her foot forward the snake moved as well. she had to move fast to catch the snake so she could take it outside. the snake was discribed as a running shoelace, which in a way is gerund, a verb that hides and becomes a noun and will most of the time end in -ing. next the author scooped her wrist and picked the snake up and now she had to get it outside. but why outside? snake like sunlight and also i don't think the author wants a wild snkae in her house. also the snake needs to have some sunlight and not be trapped in a basement with no sunlight at all. most people describe basements as a scary place with a cold and deadly feeling. now how did the snake show his/her thanks to the author? that's easy. most animals will raise their heads to show you that they want to thank you. not all animals do this, some might just want you to scratch their ear and they'll go "oh yeah!", but in this case it was thanks. animals are smart and i bet the snake has watched humans. humans rasie their heads as a thanks or a hello and the snale might have picked up on it. in the end the snake said thank you and ran off. personally i think i would run off as well. why you might be asking? that's becuase to say thank you and stay is bad. plus the snake could have seen or senced the fear in the author of it crwaling around her. note that this is how i think the snkae changed through out this poem.|

explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|the differences between ethnic cleansing and genocide are slim if you already have a formed opinion about each of them. ethnic cleansing focuses on eliminating another group from the area in order to rid of those who do not fit the desired characteristics. ethnic cleansing involves trying to increase the population of the race trying to cleanse their area. an example of ethnic cleansing in history is the hutus and the tutsis in rwanda. the hutus populated their area with the tutsis and then did their best to rid of their ethnicity. genocide is the discrimination of a race during the strive to racially purify a group of people with undesired characteristics. genocide includes not associating with the discriminated group in any way and the attempt to completely wipe out that specific race because they are inferior. an example of genocide is the holocaust. hitler and the nazis had a specific hatred towards the jewish population called antisemitism. this led them to mass murder the jews in hopes to purify their race or "aryanize" the others.|

explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.75|genocide is when a group of people try and kill a whole group of people or in part. ethnic cleansing is when a group of people is trying to remove a group of people maybe by moving them to another county or maybe even killing them. an example of genocide is the holocaust when the nazi tried to kill of all the jews because they where seen as less then people. nazis and germany believed that the jews where going to contaminate the aryan race. an example of an ethnic cleansing is before the holocaust when the nazis and germans tried to move the jews to other places.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing is that genocide is when someone tries to kill or harm of a certain group of race, ethnicity, or religion. an ethnic cleansing is when someone tries to move an ethnic group out of a certain territory and remove that ethnicity. the holocaust is an example of a genocide, hitler killed and harmed many jews in his concentration camps. an example of ethnic cleansing is with the bosnian conflict, the serbs did not want any of the bosnians in that region, there were deaths as a result of war, but they were trying to cleanse yugoslavia of bosnians.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|ethnic cleansing can be a form of genocide, but genocide is a much broader topic. genocide encompasses killing, torturing, preventing births and other horrendous actions as long as they are preformed with the intent to destroy an ethnic, racial or other type of group. examples are the holocaust and the genocide in rwanda.ethnic cleansing is usually about removing all the people of one group from an area, not to destroy them. it seems that usually many people are killed and lots of genocide-like things occur in ethnic cleansing, but the intent is different. an example of this is the genocide/ ethnic cleansing (historians have different ideas on which it is, it could be considered both) that happened in bosnia.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is the means of trying to kill of an entire race through causing mental or bodily harm, preventing birth within that race, and the mass murder of the race. in wwii, hitler decided that jewish people were "not fit for society" and they made germany weaker, so he decided to kill off that "race" of jewish people. the problem with that is jewism is not a race, but a religion. ethnic classing is what happened in rwanda. ethnic cleansing is the "cleaning" of a race, trying to make that race as clean and pure as possible. ethnic cleansing involves killing people, but not the entire race. its killing who is not pure enough in that race.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing is that genocide is the intent to destroy in whole or in part a group of people belonging to a certain religious, racial, or ethical group while ethnic cleansing is the effort to create a homogeneous nation by removing all other people not part of that group. genocide is done by killing, mentally and physically harming, preventing births, moving children to another group, and forcefully making people change groups and beliefs. ethnic cleansing can be done in a variety of ways, whether it is a forced evacuation or killing. an example of genocide is the holocaust because hitler had the intent to kill off the jewish and other "inferior" populations. he did this by using the methods of genocide. an example of ethnic cleansing was in bosnia. although the serbs did do some of the things listed as genocide, their main intent was to get the croats and serbs out of bosnia so they could make it an all serb nation.|

explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide and ethnic cleansing differ in their goals, the groups they target, and the acts they include. genocide is the attempt to destroy, in whole or in part, a group of people, while ethnic cleansing is the attempt to create an area that contains only one ethnic group by forcibly deporting and removing members of a different ethnic group. genocide and ethnic cleansing are also different in that genocide can be directed at members of a religious, ethical, national, or other groups, while ethnic cleansing is directed at members of a certain ethnic group. genocide can involve killing members of a group, causing serious harm to members of a group, imposing deadly conditions on members of a group, preventing births within the group, or moving the children of the group to another group, while ethnic cleansing can include destroying the ethnic group's houses of warship, cemeteries, and monuments. an example of genocide is the holocaust, and an example of ethnic cleansing are the events in bosnia.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|the term genocide means to kill off, or harm-physically or mentally- members of an ethnic, religious or other group. an example of this is in the holocaust when hitler and his followers killed off jews in germany because he saw them as insuperior to the german aryan race and believed that to be a significant reason to kill them in the millions. an ethnic cleansing is where a government tries to remove a specific race from an area in hopes of creating a more pure gene pool. an example of this is in rwanda when the hutu population believed that the tutsis were not worthy of their blood and wanted them to no longer be part of their area in hopes that there would be less reproduction of them in that area.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is the extermination of a race. ethnic cleansing is just the removal of an ethnicity in that region of the world (typically country). the holocaust is an example of genocide. the nazi's wanted the entire jewish population wiped out. the bosnian war in yugoslavia however is an example of ethnic cleansing. bosnia wanted to remove the muslims for their country in one way or another and did so by sending them out of their borders or in concentration camps.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is the whole or in part destruction of an entire race or ethnic group of people. an example of this would be the holocaust where the nazis put the jewish population of europe in ghettos,concentration camps or just shot them. ethnic cleansing, is the removal or destruction of certain artifacts for a certain race but its not necessarily trying to kill them all off just removing a race of people from a certain area. the bosnian incident could be considered a ethnic cleansing. because the serbs did not necessarily want to wipe out all of the other groups they just wanted a serbian country for serbs. but while doing so they removed much of the other groups from their wanted lands.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.75|genocide is where you want to harm them, kill them because they are a different race, or religion, or even a different ethnic. the holocaust was one. germans killed thousands of jews because they thought they were threat to their race.ethnic cleansing is where you want a certain area free of a ethnicity. between the croats and muslims.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is any action with the intent to physically destroy, in whole or in part, an ethnic, political, national, or racial group by doing any of the following: killing members of the group, causing serious bodily/mental harm, imposing conditions of life calculated to bring about death, preventing births in the group, and/or forcibly transferring children out of the group. ethnic cleansing is any action taken with the intent to remove a group from a certain geographic area, including destroying any significant physical things of the group such as homes, religious buildings, etc.an example of genocide is the holocaust, in which 6 million jews (here considered a "racial" group) and 5 million others were killed by the nazi party with the intent to eradicate all jews. this is a genocide because members of the jewish "racial" group were killed, caused serious bodily/mental harm (surviving gunshots or gas, rape, forced labor, etc.), and imposing conditions calculated to bring about death (poor concentration/labor/death camp conditions).an example of ethnic cleansing is bosnia. this is an ethnic cleansing because the goal of the serbs, the perpetrators, was to take over the region of bosnia for serbian land. in order to achieve this goal, the serbs mainly (before the massacres) tried to deport bosnians (or they fled to other countries), and the serbs also destroyed bosnian public buildings. it could also be argued that bosnia was an ethnic cleansing and not a genocide because people were killed, tortured, etc., but not to the extent of other atrocities such as the holocaust, armenia, and rwanda.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing mean two totally different things. genocide refers to the destruction of a group in whole or in part, while an ethnic cleansing is the movement of an ethnic group out of an area, not to destroy the group. the holocaust was a genocide because the main focus for the nazis was to destroy groups of people who they deemed "unfit". rwanda could count as an ethnic cleansing because the tutus were forced out of rwanda because the government there preferred the hutus rather than the tutus.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.75|genocide is mass killings with intentions of wiping out an entire population. the holocaust is an example of genocide; the nazis had the intentions of killing all of the jews.ethnic cleansing is when the perpetrators want to eliminate all of an ethnicity from a geographical location. the bosnian genocide is an example of ethnic cleansing; the croatians wanted to get bosnian muslims out of bosnia.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.5|the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing is that in the jewish genocide it was originally cut out to be an ethnic cleansing which means that a race is to be driven out of an area. the germans started out with the ethnic cleansing by transporting people out of the country and everything was going good till the revolts and the rebellion. then people were being murdered in gas chambers and in the definition of genocide is the killing in whole or in part of a race, ethnicity, or gender. the rwandan genocide was the only genocide that started from another country through imperialism. families turned on families, neighbor turned on neighbor and that was all formed by the europeans telling the rwanda's that they are better than everyone else and converting them to christianity.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.5|the differences between genocide and ethnic cleansing are that genocide is the killing or extermination of groups of people based on color,race,religion,sexual preference, and ethnic cleansing is the killing of a group of people based on race, religion they interm can be misused for each other because in many ways they are similar but the holocaust for example is a genocide because it is the mass killing of millions of jews and gays and people who did not wish to follow nazi rule, but the killings in rwanda are genocides because less people are killed and it is of one particular group|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is the complete extermination of a religous, political, social, or other group. the goal is to wipe the target of the genocide off the map. in an ethnic cleansing, the goal is to get rid of certain people to leave one ethnicity in a country or given area. usually in an ethnic cleansing people are deported or killed. genocide is complete extermination, while ethnic cleansing isthe cleaning out of peoples to establish one ethnicity in an area.the holocaust is an example of genocide, and the bosniak cleansing in bosnia is a n example of ethnic cleansing.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.75|genocide was killing off people in a group and preventing births in a group. they wanted to kill everyone in a certain group. ethnic cleansing is also killing people but people would get rid of the churches, schools, and other places that certain ethnic groups would go to. they wanted to get rid of those things. one example of genocide is the holocaust because they were trying to kill mostly just all of the jews. an example of ethnic cleansing is the hutu and tutsi fights in rwanda. the hutus wanted to destroy things that the tutsis had.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.75|the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing is that the definition of genocide states "actions committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part...". this doesn't exist in the definition of ethnic cleansing. genocide is done with the intent to kill, to destroy or annihilate the entire population. ethnic cleansing is done with the intent simply to get rid of them in the geographic area. killing is involved in ethnic cleansing, but it isn't the initial intent. one example of genocide was the rwandan genocide, because the hutus wanted to kill the tutsis, it was their initial intent. one example of ethnic cleansing was the holocaust, because the nazis' original reason for getting rid of the jews, other than antisemitism, was living space. germany wanted to be self sufficient. the nazis used forced emigration as a first solution, then turned to extermination when that wasn't fast, efficient, and cheap enough.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.75|a genocide is intentionally destroying in whole or in part of a group of people. an ethnic cleansing is killing in whole or in part of an ethnic group. a genocide would be when the nazis took the jews into concentration camps and made them work then send them to death camps. an ethnic cleansing would be when the hutu tried to wipe out the tutsi ethnic group in rwanda. i kind of think that the hutu trying to kill that many people of an ethnic group might as well be genocide.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is when something is done with the intent to destroy a ethnic, religious,social, or racial group, most of the time this is done through murder. whereas ethnic cleansing is when something is done to get rid of an ethnic group, often done through deportation and displacement. the holocaust is a genocide, whereas rwanda is considered an ethnic cleansing.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.5|genocide is when someone is killed or harmed in any way. jews were their own group and hitler didn't like jews when he came to power in germany. they were put in concentration camps to die. the jews were led on death marches so there was no evidence that proved what hitler did and that concentration camps existed. ethnic cleansing is when there are major ethnic groups living in one spot and people are displaced by moving them away from their original ethnic groups. in rwanda, the hutu don't like the tutsi so the hutu would get rid of them so there would only be one ethnic group above the others.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is when a certain group of people are being killed for their religion or ethnic origin. genocide is carried out in many different ways some of these include death camps, shootings, sterilization of women to prevent reproduction, and some children were kidnapped to be forced to live as a different religion or ethnic group. ethnic cleansing on the other hand was mainly used to try and evacuate a group of people out of a certain land area. an example of genocide is when the holocaust occurs and tons of jews and other groups were put into death camps and were sometimes just killed because the nazis saw them as an in superior race. an example of ethnic cleansing would be during the rwanda revolution because the hutu wanted to evacuate the tutsi because they felt that they were superior and they shouldn't have to work for the tutsi anymore.|
