use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |0.75|we could have sent troops, we could have tried sitting down and talking with japanese leaders, we could have fought fair instead of practically incinerating hundreds of thousand of people.|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |1|invading japan with an invasion force larger then on normandy. continuing the current attack strategy. the last is wait for the soviet union to close around japan causing them to surrender.|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |0.75|some alternative courses of action that could have ended the war were an allied invasion of the japanese home islands. a compromise could have been made between the allied nations and japan so that no more killing would have to be done. and also the u.s could have threatened them with the bomb and if the japanese didn't think it was real, the us could drop a bomb near the island but not near enough to injure.|

source: ogt released test materials  describe four effects of industrialization on living and working conditions for the early industrial working class that moved to the new industrial towns of 19th-century britain.|1|1) industrialization caused mass urbanization because as factories and all of the jobs became more and more centered around cities, people flocked to the cities in order to get those jobs. because of an influx of people coming in in such a short period of time, cheap and quickly built housing was created, creating unclean and dangerous living conditions in cities.2) because factories required many people to function and factory jobs were one of the only ways to make a living at the time, many families worked in factories, even the women and children. the machines used were extremely dangerous due to their massive size and moving components, and whenever something within it broke, children were sent under the machine to fix it, often killing them. this risk and constant occurrence of death in the factories made the working conditions much worse for workers than their previous in-home workplaces. eventually, child labor laws were passed to prevent this.3) because factories burned coal to function, they released smoke and soot into the air, horribly polluting britain's air, land, and water. both workers and everyday people had to breathe in the smoke, causing health problems and general uncleanliness. also, because the factories were centered around cities, cities became extremely dirty and difficult to live in.4) since industrialization meant that things were mass-produced by producing many parts then putting them together later, things became much cheaper to make. because of how little it cost to produce in the factories, workers barely made any money (which is also why families had to work there together to get by.) these insanely low wages under dangerous conditions drove more and more people into near-poverty, which forced people to live in the dirty urban conditions and eventually sparked the rebellion that led to minimum wage laws.|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |1|an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, conventional bombing, and submarine war against japan.|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |1|three alternative actions that could have been used to end the war with japan would of been an allied invasion on japan, japan opening surrender negotiations with the us, and continuing with the conventional bombing and submarine war.|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |1|1) one would have been to send all all out invasion into japan. 2) would have been to continue to fire bomb and torpedo japan. 3) would have waited for japanese attempts to surrender through the ussr.|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |1|three alternative ways america could end the war with japan are conventional bombing and submarine war, political approach, and accept negotiations from japan. the united states air force and navy had said that the us could win the war with continued conventional bombing and submarine attacks. the previous ambassador to japan, joseph grew, had said that they could use a political approach to win the war. japan also had opened up negotiation for surrender that america ignored because we wanted to show our power.|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |1|•conventional bombing •submarine warfare•allied invasion of japanese homelands|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |1|1) u.s. invasion of the japan.2) continued fire bombing and submarine attacks.3) negotiate surrender terms with japan.|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |1|three alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan are: an allied invasion of japanese home islands, accepting japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations, and the us could have continued to bomb cities without atomic bombs.|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |1|the first course of action would be to sent troops on the main land of the japanese island, the second was to continue to bomb the 37 japanese cities, and the third was to force the unconditional surrender of the japanese|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |0.75|1. continuing the submarine war.2. continuing to fire-bombings on japanese cities. 3. an allied invasion on the japanese home lands.|

explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|ethnic cleansing is the idea of homogenous nation. people thought they could execute or deport people that they didn't want in their soon to be perfect cutural nation. genocide is the same idea as ethnic cleansing in my opinion. with the exception of genocides have mass murder, rape camps, and torture. they separate families from their children and men are usually taken away from their families as well. i am choosing to do the holocaust for both of my answers. i don't believe that any of the genocides we talked about this term are ethnic cleansing. i believe genocides like the holocaust could have started with the idea of ethinic cleansing. for instance, in the movie we watched a little while ago the men were talking about 'executing' jews, gypsies,christians, and anyone who wasn't part of the culture them men were trying to preserve. that didn't happen though. around 6 million jews died during the holocaust and 12 million people died overall. the definition of genocide may not fit some of the mass killings that have happened in the past but wouldn't say it is ethnic cleansing that is for sure.|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |0.5|three alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki are signing a treaty with japan, dropping out of the war all together and surrendering to japan.|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |1|1. the americans could have continued with conventinal bombings and submarine warfare.2. could have worked harder and listened more to japanese surrender attempts.3. the americans could have gone through with the invasion of japanese home islands.|

use the excerpt below to answer the question that follows:    at approximately 8.15am on 6 august 1945 a us b-29 bomber dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of hiroshima, instantly killing around 80,000 people. three days later, a second bomb was dropped on nagasaki, causing the deaths of 40,000 more. the dropping of the bombs, which occurred by executive order of us president harry truman, remains the only nuclear attack in history. in the months following the attack, roughly 100,000 more people died slow, horrendous deaths as a result of radiation poisoning   although voices within the us military expressed caution regarding the use of the new weapon against japan, truman was convinced that the bomb was the correct and only option. six months of intense strategic fire-bombing of 37 japanese cities had done little to break the hirohito regime’s resolve, and japan continued to resolutely ignore the demand for unconditional surrender made at potsdam. in such circumstances, the use of the atom bomb was seen as the best means of forcing japan to surrender, and ending the war. the alternative, of an allied invasion of the japanese home islands, was expected to cost hundreds of thousands of casualties.   as questions regarding the ethical implications of the attacks grew, the us air force and navy both published reports which claimed (respectively) that the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have soon forced her to surrender. joseph grew, america’s last ambassador to japan before the war started, also publicly alleged that the truman administration knew about (and ignored) japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us using the ussr as a mediator. at this time, another…emerged: the atomic bombing of japan had been motivated by a desire to demonstrate the us’s military might to the soviet union, about whom the americans were increasingly nervous.   the moral aspect of the attacks upon hiroshima and nagasaki continues to divide historians. while some argue that the terrible long term human cost to the japanese population can never justify the use of such weapons, others maintain that in the context of total war, it would have been immoral if atomic weapons had not been used to end the war as quickly as possible.  source: the history channel http://www.history.co.uk/explore-history/ww2/atomic-bomb.html     list the 3 alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki? |0|three alternative courses of action that could have been used to end the war with japan rather than the dropping of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki could have been:1. an allied invasion on the japanese home islands. this would have only cost around 100,000 of lives rather than a million. 2. the conventional bombing and submarine war against japan would have forced them to surrender. but the us wanted to show/ demonstrate how much military power that they have. 3. truman ignored the japanese attempts to open surrender negotiations with the us. which then the atomic bomb on nagasaki occurred.|

explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing is that in ethnic cleansing, the perpetrators are trying to get rid of a certain ethnic group, religion, or race but their intent is not to destroy them. in genocide, the perpetrators want the race, religion, ethnic group gone completely from the rest of their country/the world. the holocaust is an example of genocide because hitler wanted all of the jews out of europe and found ways to kill them (and other groups) in mass numbers. what happened in bosnia is an ethnic cleansing because they wanted states inhabited by that ethnicity (serbia for serbs, bosnia for bosniaks) but if there was a person with both bosnian and serbian blood in them, the serbs wouldn't kill them because they were somewhat serb. serbians were trying to make more serbs so instead of killing people who were bosniaks, men would impregnate the bosnian women so they would have "serb" children. serbians were not trying to kill all bosnians, they were trying to create more serbs.|

explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is the extermination of a race. ethnic cleansing is just the removal of an ethnicity in that region of the world (typically country). the holocaust is an example of genocide. the nazi's wanted the entire jewish population wiped out. the bosnian war in yugoslavia however is an example of ethnic cleansing. bosnia wanted to remove the muslims for their country in one way or another and did so by sending them out of their borders or in concentration camps.|

explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.5|the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing is that in the jewish genocide it was originally cut out to be an ethnic cleansing which means that a race is to be driven out of an area. the germans started out with the ethnic cleansing by transporting people out of the country and everything was going good till the revolts and the rebellion. then people were being murdered in gas chambers and in the definition of genocide is the killing in whole or in part of a race, ethnicity, or gender. the rwandan genocide was the only genocide that started from another country through imperialism. families turned on families, neighbor turned on neighbor and that was all formed by the europeans telling the rwanda's that they are better than everyone else and converting them to christianity.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.5|the differences between genocide and ethnic cleansing are that genocide is the killing or extermination of groups of people based on color,race,religion,sexual preference, and ethnic cleansing is the killing of a group of people based on race, religion they interm can be misused for each other because in many ways they are similar but the holocaust for example is a genocide because it is the mass killing of millions of jews and gays and people who did not wish to follow nazi rule, but the killings in rwanda are genocides because less people are killed and it is of one particular group|

explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.75|the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing is that the definition of genocide states "actions committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part...". this doesn't exist in the definition of ethnic cleansing. genocide is done with the intent to kill, to destroy or annihilate the entire population. ethnic cleansing is done with the intent simply to get rid of them in the geographic area. killing is involved in ethnic cleansing, but it isn't the initial intent. one example of genocide was the rwandan genocide, because the hutus wanted to kill the tutsis, it was their initial intent. one example of ethnic cleansing was the holocaust, because the nazis' original reason for getting rid of the jews, other than antisemitism, was living space. germany wanted to be self sufficient. the nazis used forced emigration as a first solution, then turned to extermination when that wasn't fast, efficient, and cheap enough.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.75|a genocide is intentionally destroying in whole or in part of a group of people. an ethnic cleansing is killing in whole or in part of an ethnic group. a genocide would be when the nazis took the jews into concentration camps and made them work then send them to death camps. an ethnic cleansing would be when the hutu tried to wipe out the tutsi ethnic group in rwanda. i kind of think that the hutu trying to kill that many people of an ethnic group might as well be genocide.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is when something is done with the intent to destroy a ethnic, religious,social, or racial group, most of the time this is done through murder. whereas ethnic cleansing is when something is done to get rid of an ethnic group, often done through deportation and displacement. the holocaust is a genocide, whereas rwanda is considered an ethnic cleansing.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |0.5|genocide is when someone is killed or harmed in any way. jews were their own group and hitler didn't like jews when he came to power in germany. they were put in concentration camps to die. the jews were led on death marches so there was no evidence that proved what hitler did and that concentration camps existed. ethnic cleansing is when there are major ethnic groups living in one spot and people are displaced by moving them away from their original ethnic groups. in rwanda, the hutu don't like the tutsi so the hutu would get rid of them so there would only be one ethnic group above the others.|
explain the difference between the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing. give one example of each throughout world history.  |1|genocide is when a certain group of people are being killed for their religion or ethnic origin. genocide is carried out in many different ways some of these include death camps, shootings, sterilization of women to prevent reproduction, and some children were kidnapped to be forced to live as a different religion or ethnic group. ethnic cleansing on the other hand was mainly used to try and evacuate a group of people out of a certain land area. an example of genocide is when the holocaust occurs and tons of jews and other groups were put into death camps and were sometimes just killed because the nazis saw them as an in superior race. an example of ethnic cleansing would be during the rwanda revolution because the hutu wanted to evacuate the tutsi because they felt that they were superior and they shouldn't have to work for the tutsi anymore.|
